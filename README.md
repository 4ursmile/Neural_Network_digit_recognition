# Neural_Network_digit_recognition
This project build a simple L3 Neural network for digit recognition
How to use this:

+You can clone or download this repo

+Your PC need to have python (my version 3.10):

+Need have numpy, pandas and openCV

how to install:

-python: https://apps.microsoft.com/store/detail/9PJPW5LDXLZ5?hl=vi-vn&gl=VN

-package: you need pip (python from link above has pip by default, if you don't have, follow this link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installation/)

-use command line or terminal on vscode, run all command below:
+ pip install opencv-python
+ pip install pandas
+ pip install numpy
You need some extension for python to havebetter experience

OR,

use google colab and skip all the steps above

Now, Let's get started


In train.py file:
 
 +My program can reuse data from previous trainning, so you can train again, change parameter or optimize it.
 
 +All train information save in TrainLog.txt, so you can see information about previous trainning and of course information about your trainning

In test.py file:
 
 +Use can run it again to re-classify image, or change input data to classify your own images.
